# Prompt Log – Tic-Tac-Toe Game (HTML/CSS/JS)
## 1. Initial Prompt
I asked ChatGPT:

> "Hello Team,  
> As discussed, please use prompting techniques and create a simple game.
> Task 1:
> Let's build simple, fun, fully playable browser games using only:
> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Prompting skills (using ChatGPT or any coding assistant).
> No frameworks, no backend. I would like to build Tic-Tac-Toe.
> Can you give me index.html, style.css, and script.js?"

## 2. Follow-up Prompts
I then asked follow-up questions to better understand the code and logic:
- "Can you explain how the game logic works in simple terms?"
- "How is the winner checked in the JavaScript?"
- "What is the role of the boardState array?"
- "How do we reset the game?"

## 3. How I Used the Responses
- I copied the suggested structure (index.html, style.css, script.js).
- I read through the explanations to understand:
  - how event listeners are attached to each cell,
  - how `boardState` tracks the moves internally,
  - how winning combinations are checked.
- I modified the UI text and comments where needed to match my understanding.

## 4. What I Learned
- How to organize a small web project into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- How to handle click events in vanilla JavaScript.
- How to represent a game board as an array and check for winning patterns.
- How to use prompting with ChatGPT to iteratively build and understand a project.
